## Challenge -- 💡

It is a basic Doom-like game. I made the graphic engine myself using a graphic library mlx given by my school. the library is based on openGL. you can pick up keys and open door as well as wandering around a custom maze given as argument to the main exe.
The format for the map is imposed in some conditions and must contain the path to the textures used for the walls the key and the door.
